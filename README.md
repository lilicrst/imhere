<h1>
  imhere Presence List
</h1>

This is my first React Native project. I applied the basic knowledge to make an attendance list for events.

## Layout and functions

![Empty list](/readme/home.jpg)
![List](/readme/home_1.jpg)
![FlatList](/readme/home_2.jpg)


It is possible to add and remove participants.

![Alert](/readme/alert_1.jpg)
![Alert](/readme/home_1.jpg)


There are alerts for delete confirmation and repeated keys.

## Running the project

Use the **yarn** or the **npm install** to install project dependencies.
Then start the project.

```cl
expo start
```
