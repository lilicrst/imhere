<h1>
  imhere Presence List
</h1>

This is my first React Native project. I applied the basic knowledge to make an attendance list for events.

## Layout and functions

![FlatList](https://github.com/lilicrst/imhere/blob/master/readme/home_2.jpg)
</p>

It is possible to add and remove participants.

There are alerts for delete confirmation and repeated keys.

## Running the project

Use the **yarn** or the **npm install** to install project dependencies.
Then start the project.
